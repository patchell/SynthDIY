My Synthesizer PC boards

This is a collection of PC boards I have designed over the years to create analog synthesizer systems.  The schematics are 
drawn with Orcad 9.2 and the PC board layouts were done with Protel 2.7.

I realize that these are not open source programs.  Maybe somebody will eventually write 
a program that will translage this file formats to something
that is open source.
